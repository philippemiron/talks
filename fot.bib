@article{Hamilton-etal-17,
	Abstract = {Fourteen autonomous profiling floats, equipped with CTDs, were deployed in the deep eastern and western basins of the Gulf of Mexico over a four-year interval (July 2011--August 2015), producing a total of 706 casts. This is the first time since the early 1970s that there has been a comprehensive survey of water masses in the deep basins of the Gulf, with better vertical resolution than available from older ship-based surveys. Seven floats had 14-day cycles with parking depths of 1500 m, and the other half from the U.S. Argo program had varying cycle times. Maps of characteristic water masses, including Subtropical Underwater, Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and North Atlantic Deep Water, showed gradients from east to west, consistent with their sources being within the Loop Current (LC) and the Yucatan Channel waters. Altimeter SSH was used to characterize profiles being in LC or LC eddy water or in cold eddies. The two-layer nature of the deep Gulf shows isotherms being deeper in the warm anticyclonic LC and LC eddies and shallower in the cold cyclones. Mixed layer depths have an average seasonal signal that shows maximum depths (~60 m) in January and a minimum in June--July (~20 m). Basin-mean steric heights from 0--50-m dynamic heights and altimeter SSH show a seasonal range of ~12 cm, with significant interannual variability. The translation of LC eddies across the western basin produces a region of low homogeneous potential vorticity centered over the deepest part of the western basin. },

@article{Perez-etal-17,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe large-scale circulation of the bottom layer of the Gulf of Mexico is analyzed, with special attention to the historically least studied western basin. The analysis is based on 4 years of data collected by 158 subsurface floats parked at 1500 and 2500 m and is complemented with data collected by current meter moorings in the western basin during the same period. Three main circulation patterns stand out: a cyclonic boundary current, a cyclonic gyre in the abyssal plain, and the very high eddy kinetic energy observed in the eastern Gulf. The boundary current and the cyclonic gyre appear as distinct features, which interact in the western tip of the Yucatan shelf. The persistence and continuity of the boundary current is addressed. Although high variability is observed, the boundary flow serves as a pathway for water to travel around the western basin in approximately 2 years. An interesting discovery is the separation of the boundary current over the northwestern slope of the Yucatan shelf. The separation and retroflection of the along-slope current appears to be a persistent feature and is associated with anticyclonic eddies whose genesis mechanism remains to be understood. As the boundary flow separates, it feeds into the westward flow of the deep cyclonic gyre. The location of this gyre---named the Sigsbee Abyssal Gyre---coincides with closed geostrophic contours, so eddy--topography interaction via bottom form stresses may drive this mean flow. The contribution to the cyclonic vorticity of the gyre by modons traveling under Loop Current eddies is discussed.},

@article{Ardhuin-etal-09,
	Abstract = { Abstract The surface current response to winds is analyzed in a 2-yr
	time series of a 12-MHz (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) off the west coast
	of France. Consistent with previous observations, the measured currents,
	after filtering tides, are on the order of 1.0\%--1.8\% of the wind
	speed, in a direction 10$\,^{\circ}$--40$\,^{\circ}$ to the right of the wind and with
	systematic trends as a function of wind speed. This Lagrangian current
	can be decomposed as the vector sum of a quasi-Eulerian current UE,
	representative of the top 1 m of the water column and part of the
	wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface. Here, Uss is estimated
	with an accurate numerical wave model using a novel parameterization
	of wave dissipation processes. Using both observed and modeled wave
	spectra, Uss is found to be very well approximated by a simple function
	of the wind speed and significant wave height, generally increasing
	quadratically with the wind speed. Focusing on a site located 100
	km from the mainland, the wave-induced contribution of Uss to the
	radar measurement has an estimated magnitude of 0.6\%--1.3\% of the
	wind speed, in the wind direction---a percentage that increases with
	wind speed. The difference UE of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions
	is found to be on the order of 0.4\%--0.8\% of the wind speed and
	45$\,^{\circ}$--70$\,^{\circ}$ to the right of the wind. This relatively weak, quasi-Eulerian
	current with a large deflection angle is interpreted as evidence
	of strong near-surface mixing, likely related to breaking waves and/or
	Langmuir circulations. Summer stratification tends to increase the
	UE response by up to a factor of 2 on average and further increase
	the deflection angle of UE by 5$\,^{\circ}$--10$\,^{\circ}$. At locations closer to the
	coast, Uss is smaller and UE is larger with a smaller deflection
	angle. These results would be transposable to the World Ocean if
	the relative part of geostrophic currents in UE was weak, which is
	expected. This decomposition into Stokes drift and quasi-Eulerian
	current is most important for the estimation of energy fluxes to
	the Ekman layer. },

@article{Wu-83,
	Abstract = { Abstract Wind-induced shell currents and wave-induced mass transports
	at various fetches of both clean and slick sea surfaces are separately
	estimated. At the clean surface, the ratio between wind-induced current
	and wind velocity decreases, while the ratio between wave-induced
	current and wind velocity increases, with increasing fetch. The total
	surface drift current, the sum of wind- and wave-induced components,
	decreases gradually with increasing fetch and approaches 3.1\% of
	wind velocity at long fetches, comparing very favorably with measured
	values. At a slick surface, the wind-induced drift current is reduced
	due to a decrease of the wind-stress coefficient and the wave-induced
	mass transport is increased due to an additional wave damping. As
	a result of these opposite effects, the total surface drift current
	at a slick surface differs much less significantly than individual
	components from that at a clean surface. It is also suggested that
	the surface mass transport can be calculated simply from characteristics
	of dominant waves and that discrepancy between earlier measured currents
	of clean and slick surfaces is due to a direct momentum flux from
	wind to waves. Finally, linear superposition of wind- and wave-induced
	components and effects of water depth on surface drift currants are
	discussed. },

	Abstract = { Abstract In this study the influence of surface waves on the mean
	flow in an ocean of arbitrary depth is examined. The wave-induced
	forcing on the mean flow is obtained by integrating the Eulerian
	equations for mass and momentum balance from the bottom to an undulating
	material surface within the water column. By using the mean position
	of the material surface as the vertical coordinate, the authors obtain
	the depth dependence of the mean flow and the wave-induced forcing.
	Substitution of the vertical coordinate makes the model Lagrangian
	in the vertical direction. The model is Eulerian in the horizontal
	direction, allowing one to model the effects of a spatially nonuniform
	wave field or varying depth in a straightforward way. },

@article{Kuhlbrodt-07,
	Abstract = {Because of its relevance for the global climate the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been a major research focus for many years. Yet the question of which physical mechanisms ultimately drive the AMOC, in the sense of providing its energy supply, remains a matter of controversy. Here we review both observational data and model results concerning the two main candidates: vertical mixing processes in the ocean's interior and wind릋nduced Ekman upwelling in the Southern Ocean. In distinction to the energy source we also discuss the role of surface heat and freshwater fluxes, which influence the volume transport of the meridional overturning circulation and shape its spatial circulation pattern without actually supplying energy to the overturning itself in steady state. We conclude that both wind릁riven upwelling and vertical mixing are likely contributing to driving the observed circulation. To quantify their respective contributions, future research needs to address some open questions, which we outline.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical results relating to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory,
	particularly those dealing with the stability of degenerate one-degree-of-freedom
	Hamiltonian systems under a time-quasiperiodic perturbation, have
	led to the expectation that, independent of the background Potential
	Vorticity (PV) distribution, associated with zonal jets should be
	barriers which inhibit meridional transport. In a recently submitted
	paper (Beron-Vera et al. , 2011) the aforementioned expectation is
	confirmed based on the analysis of isentropic winds in the lower
	stratosphere as produced by a comprehensive general circulation model.
	Concretely, barriers for meridional transport are found to be associated
	with the (eastward) austral polar night jet, for which the meridional
	gradient of background PV is very steep and also for the (westward)
	boreal summer subtropical jet, for which the background PV is rather
	uniform. The identification of the meridional transport barriers
	is based on the computation of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE),
	which measures the amount of stretching about fluid particle trajectories.
	The meridional transport barriers, which are formed by fluid particle
	trajectories lying on invariant tori, are identified with topologically
	circular locally minimizing curves or trenches of the backward-plus-forward
	FTLE field. Results from explicit passive tracer advection experiments
	and flux computations are also presented, which confirm those inferred
	using the FTLE diagnostic. In this paper I present results based
	on the analysis of analytically prescribed stratospheric model winds,
	which complement the results presented in Beron-Vera et al. (2011)
	and further allow one to better assess the scope of the FTLE diagnostic.},

	drifters deployed near the Deepwater Horizon site in the Gulf of
	Mexico are investigated. The synthetic trajectories derive from a
	1-km-resolution data-assimilative Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM)
	simulation. The in situ drifters were launched in the Grand Lagrangian
	Deployment (GLAD). Diverse measures of the dispersion are calculated
	and compared to theoretical predictions. For the NCOM pairs, the
	measures indicate nonlocal pair dispersion (in which pair separations
	grow exponentially in time) at the smallest sampled scales. At separations
	exceeding 100 km, pair motion is uncorrelated, indicating absolute
	rather than relative dispersion. With the GLAD drifters, however,
	the statistics are ambiguous, with some indicating local dispersion
	(in which pair separations exhibit power-law growth) and others suggesting
	nonlocal dispersion. The difference between the two datasets stems
	in part from inertial oscillations, which affect the energy levels
	at small scales without greatly altering pair dispersion. These were
	significant in GLAD but much weaker in the NCOM simulation. In addition,
	the GLAD drifters were launched over a limited geographical area,
	producing few independent realizations and hence lower statistical
	significance. Restricting the NCOM set to pairs launched at the same
	locations yields very similar results, suggesting the model is for
	the most part capturing the observed dispersion.},

@article{Beron-Ripa-00,
	Abstract = {Previously unresolved three-dimensional aspects of the time mean,
	as well as the annual and semiannual cycles of the heat transport,
	are studied in the Gulf of California using a minimal box model suggested
	by the hydrographic data. At the very least three horizontal domains
	are needed for the model: a shallow region north of the big islands,
	a deep region identifiable with the Ballenas Channel and another
	deep region spanning the rest of the gulf south of the archipelago.
	Only one vertical layer is considered in the northern region, whereas
	two layers are taken into account in the other two regions. Out of
	all of the possible heat exchanges among the various boxes of the
	model, the least-flux-variance solution is considered. The annual
	mean heat entering the surface in the northern region is exported
	in almost equal amounts to the Ballenas Channel and the southern
	region. Ballenas Channel, in turn, exports heat to the southern region
	mainly through the lower layer, producing a transversal asymmetry
	of the mouthward flux into the upper layer. At the mouth the heat
	is exported to the Pacific Ocean largely through the upper layer.
	Both the annual and semiannual amplitude of the exchanges between
	all regions are as important as the annual average, except at the
	mouth of the gulf, where the semiannual component is not statistically
	relevant. The Pacific Ocean fluxes estimates at the annual frequency
	agree well with those produced by a baroclinic wave, which has been
	shown to explain a big deal of the thermodynamics of the gulf. The
	annual mean vertical flux per unit horizontal area in the Ballenas
	Channel is much larger than that in the southern region. This reinforces
	previous speculations that mixing processes in this region are very
	important. A depth-independent eddy diffusivity parameterization
	suggests that diffusion might not be invoked to explain the annual
	mean vertical flux in the Ballenas Channel.},

@article{Coelho-etal-15,
	Abstract = {Abstract In the summer and fall of 2012, during the \{GLAD\} experiment
	in the Gulf of Mexico, the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport
	of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) used several ocean models
	to assist the deployment of more than 300 surface drifters. The Navy
	Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) at 1&#xa0;km and 3&#xa0;km resolutions,
	the \{US\} Navy operational \{NCOM\} at 30 km resolution (AMSEAS),
	and two versions of the Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) set
	at 4&#xa0;km were running daily and delivering 72-h range forecasts.
	They all assimilated remote sensing and local profile data but they
	were not assimilating the drifter's observations. This work presents
	a non-intrusive methodology named Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter
	that allows assimilating the local drifter data into such a set of
	models, to produce improved ocean currents forecasts. The filter
	is to be used when several modeling systems or ensembles are available
	and/or observations are not entirely handled by the operational data
	assimilation process. It allows using generic in situ measurements
	over short time windows to improve the predictability of local ocean
	dynamics and associated high-resolution parameters of interest for
	which a forward model exists (e.g. oil spill plumes). Results can
	be used for operational applications or to derive enhanced background
	fields for other data assimilation systems, thus providing an expedite
	method to non-intrusively assimilate local observations of variables
	with complex operators. Results for the \{GLAD\} experiment show
	the method can improve water velocity predictions along the observed
	drifter trajectories, hence enhancing the skills of the models to
	predict individual trajectories.},

	a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into
	particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean

	Abstract = {We conclude that ridges like the Walvis Ridge tend to stabilize a
	multi-layer ring and reduce its decay.
	
	
	While the more baroclinic rings can cross the ridge more easily we
	can expect that rings that still have a relatively strong barotropic
	component while reaching the Walvis Ridge shall be slowed down or
	be steered along the bathymetry due to vorticity effects until they
	have adjusted to a less barotropic state.
	
	
	An increase of mixing due to the ridge as was suggested by for instance
	Byrne et al. (1995) and Schouten et al. (2000) is not in agreement
	with our findings. We find the same results as Kamenkovich et al.
	(1996) that rings that encounter a topographic ridge transport more
	tracer. The tracer loss of the ring that crosses the ridge is 5%
	less in the case presented here. A large topographic ridge is thus
	responsible for less stirring of Agulhas water from the ring, which
	is perhaps quite counter-intuitive. We have not, however, explored
	the effects or variations of possible small-scale mixing events due
	to, for instance, internal waves.},

	While the emphasis is on zonal flows in laboratory plasmas, planetary

	of theory, numerical simulation and experiments relevant to zonal
	flows. The emphasis is on developing an integrated understanding
	of the dynamics of drift wave-zonal flow turbulence by combining
	detailed studies of the generation of zonal flows by drift waves,
	the back-interaction of zonal flows on the drift waves and the various
	feedback loops by which the system regulates and organizes itself.
	The implications of zonal flow phenomena for confinement in and
	the phenomena of fusion devices are discussed. Special attention
	is given to the comparison of experiment with theory and to identifying
	directions for progress in future research.},

@article{Greatbatch-94,
	Abstract = {This note discusses the representation of steric sea level in ocean
	circulation models. Changes in steric sea level are caused when changes
	in the density of the water column imply an expansion or contraction
	of the column. Models usually make the Boussinesq approximation and
	conserve volume, rather than mass and so do not properly represent
	expansion or contraction. This cleans that although expansion/contraction
	is included in the equation of state, it is not accounted for by
	the model dynamics. In this note, we examine the equation governing
	the time evolution of the sea level displacement. It is shown that
	requiring conservation of mass, rather than volume, introduces a
	new term to this equation. A simple example is used to show the relationship
	of the new term to the surface buoyancy flux. The equilibrium response
	to the new term has two parts. One part consists of the Goldsbrough
	and Stommel gyres, for which, in the ocean interior, vortex stretching
	due to the local expansion/contraction of the water column is balanced
	by changes in planetary vorticity. The other part corresponds to
	the 'inverse barometer.' The effect is to adjust sea level by a globally
	uniform but time-varying factor, determined by the net expansion/contraction
	of the global ocean. Since this correction is globally uniform, it
	has no dynamical significance. Both the Goldsbrough/Stommel gyres
	and the inverse barometer solution are missing from models as currently
	formulated. This does not represent a serious error. However, if
	comparison is made with observations of sea level, model-calculated
	sea level should be adjusted by a globally uniform, tune-varying
	factor, determined by the net expansion/contraction of the global
	ocean. This would be important for assessing the likely rise in sea
	level in response to global warming.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a quasi-3D Bayesian inversion of oceanographic
	tracer data from the South Atlantic Ocean. Initially, one active
	neutral-density layer is considered with an upper and lower boundary.
	The available hydrographic data are linked to model parameters (water
	velocities, diffusion coefficients) via a 3D advection-diffusion
	equation. A robust solution to the inverse problem can be obtained
	by introducing prior information about parameters and modeling the
	observation error. This approach estimates both horizontal and vertical
	flow as well as diffusion coefficients. A system of alternating zonal
	jets is found at the depths of the North Atlantic Deep Water, consistent
	with direct measurements of flow and concentration maps. A uniqueness
	analysis of the model is performed in terms of the oxygen consumption
	rate. The vertical mixing coefficient bears some relation to the
	bottom topography even though the authors do not incorporate topography
	into their model. The method is extended to a multilayer model, using
	thermal wind relations weakly in a local fashion (as opposed to integrating
	the entire water column) to connect layers vertically. Results suggest
	that the estimated deep zonal jets extend vertically, with a clear
	depth-dependent structure. The vertical structure of the flow field
	is modified by the tracer fields relative to the a priori flow field
	defined by thermal wind. The velocity estimates are consistent with
	independent observed flow at the depths of the Antarctic Intermediate
	Water; at still shallower depths, above the layers considered here,
	the subtropical gyre is a significant feature of the horizontal flow.},

	Abstract = {A numerical model of wind-driven surface flow in the Gulf of Mexico
	is used to examine physical controls on harmful algal bloom formation
	along the Texas coast. Karenia brevis, which blooms frequently in
	the Gulf of Mexico, has a relatively slow growth rate (doubling times
	of 2-3 days). Increases in K. brevis concentration cannot be explained
	simply in terms of growth. We hypothesize that the primary mechanism
	responsible for bloom formation in the western Gulf of Mexico is
	convergence due to downwelling at the coast. Convergence along the
	Texas coast caused by seasonal downwelling winds can concentrate
	the plankton up to 1000 times. This is surprising because the modeled
	cells do not grow; the simulated increase in concentration is due
	to physical processes alone. The numerical model qualitatively reproduces
	both the timing and magnitude of bloom initiation along the coast,
	but does not predict the details of the migration of the bloom along
	the coast after it has formed, or the destruction of the bloom. The
	result of this simulation is significant because it implies that
	K. brevis blooms may be caused primarily by physical processes and
	that cell division is not an important factor in bloom formation.},

@article{Jacobs-etal-14,
	Abstract = {Abstract Ocean prediction systems rely on an array of assumptions
	to optimize their data assimilation schemes. Many of these remain
	untested, especially at smaller scales, because sufficiently dense
	observations are very rare. A set of 295 drifters deployed in July
	2012 in the north-eastern Gulf of Mexico provides a unique opportunity
	to test these systems down to scales previously unobtainable. In
	this study, background error covariance assumptions in the 3DVar
	assimilation process are perturbed to understand the effect on the
	solution relative to the withheld dense drifter data. Results show
	that the amplitude of the background error covariance is an important
	factor as expected and a proposed new formulation provides added
	skill. In addition, the background error covariance time correlation
	is important to allow satellite observations to affect the results
	over a period longer than one daily assimilation cycle. The results
	show the new background error covariance formulations provide more
	accurate placement of frontal positions, directions of currents and
	velocity magnitudes. These conclusions have implications for the
	implementation of 3DVar systems as well as the analysis interval
	of 4DVar systems.},

	Abstract = {The effect of an isolated submarine obstacle on the motion of fluid
	particles in a periodic external flow is studied within the framework
	of the barotropic, quasi-geostrophic approximation on f-plane. The
	concept of background currents advanced by Kozlov [1995. Background
	currents in geophysical hydrodynamics. Izvestia, Atmos. Oceanic Phys.
	31 (2), 245-250] is used to construct a dynamically consistent stream
	function satisfying the potential vorticity conservation law. It
	is shown that a system of two topographic vortices revolving about
	a rotation center can form in a circular external flow. Unsteady
	periodic perturbations, associated with either variations in the
	background current or deviations of the external flow from circulation,
	are analyzed. Unsteadiness in the external flow essentially complicates
	the pattern of the motion of fluid particles. Vortex-type quasi-periodic
	structures, identified with nonlinear resonances that form in Lagrangian
	equations of fluid particle advection, are examined. They either
	surround the stationary configuration by a vortex chain--a ringlet-like
	structure [Kennelly, M.A., Evans, R.H., Joyce, T.M., 1985. Small-scale
	cyclones on the periphery of Gulf Stream warm-core rings. J. Geophys.
	Res. 90(5), 8845-8857], or they form a complex-structure multivortex
	domain. Asymptotic estimates and numerical modeling are used to study
	the distribution and widths of the nonlinear resonance domains that
	appear under unsteady perturbations of different types. The onset
	of chaotic regimes owing to the overlapping of nonlinear resonance
	domains is analyzed. Transport fluxes determined by chaotic advection
	and barriers for transport (KAM-tori) and the conditions of their
	existence are studied. The relation of the rotation frequency of
	fluid particles on their initial position (when the dependence is
	calculated in the undisturbed system) is shown to completely determine
	the main features of the pattern of Lagrangian trajectories and chaotization
	effects. Because of nonlinear effects, the domain involved in quasi-periodic
	and chaotic motions can be much larger than the domain occupied by
	steady topographic vortices. The results of study by Sokolovskiy
	et al. [1988. On the influence of an isolated submerged obstacle
	on a barotropic tidal flow. Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. 88(1),
	1-30] concerning the due regard on the irrotational background component
	as the necessary factor for the transportation of fluid particles

	a structure. Such a structure consists of a set with specified functions
	and relations satisfyng specified axioms, which describe the type
	of the structure. Examples of such structures, such as groups and
	spaces, asre described. The viewpoint is now dominant in organizing
	much of mathematics, but does not cover all mathematics, in particular
	most applications. It does not explain why certain strctures are
	dominant, not why the same mathematical structure can have so many
	different and prtean realizations. ``Structure'' is just one part
	of the full situation, which must somehow connect the ideal structures

	the Lagrangian skeleton of turbulence, shows a level of complexity
	found previously only in theoretical and numerical examples of strange

	the nutrients required to sustain primary productivity of the subtropical
	ocean. New observations in the northwest Atlantic reveal that, although
	plankton blooms occur in both cyclones and mode-water eddies, the
	biological responses differ. Mode-water eddies can generate extraordinary
	diatom biomass and primary production at depth, relative to the time
	series near Bermuda. These blooms are sustained by eddy/wind interactions,
	which amplify the eddy-induced upwelling. In contrast, eddy/wind
	interactions dampen eddy-induced upwelling in cyclones. Carbon export
	inferred from oxygen anomalies in eddy cores is one to three times
	as much as annual new production for the region.},

@article{Moore-Peltier-90b,
	Abstract = {The problem of the origin of midlatitude cyclonic disturbances having
	characteristic spatial scales of 1000 km or less has remained outstanding
	for most of this century. Although the theory of baroclinic instability
	of Charney and Eady has often been assumed to account for their appearance,
	Charney himself recognized that this was not so. In an attempt to
	develop a unique explanation for the observed scale of these systems
	we have been reinvestigating the classical problem of the baroclinic
	instability of synoptic-scale frontal zones. This work has shown
	that when the stability of such regions is analyzed using the hydrostatic
	primitive equations, a new mode of baroclinic instability is revealed,
	which has precisely the required scale. The new mode is completely
	filtered out in both the quasi-geostrophic and semigeostrophic systems.
	
	
	 In the present paper we return to the primitive equations system
	to further analyze this problem and to refine the numerical formulation
	so as to enable an accurate investigation of the sensitivity of the
	growth rate and spatial scale of the new mode to the detailed properties
	of the background frontal flow. This demonstrates that focusing of
	the region of low Richardson number near the surface is most conducive
	to the growth of the cyclone wave.},

	Abstract = {The relative importance of Lagrangian and population dynamics on
	
	 spatial pattern formation in the distribution of plankton near the
	
	 ocean's surface is investigated. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are
	
	 treated as biologically interacting tracers that are passively
	
	 advected by a divergence-free two-dimensional nonsteady velocity
	
	 field. The time-dependence of this field is assumed to be
	
	 quasiperiodic, which extends the analysis presented beyond standard
	
	 chaotic advection. Various forms of predator--prey interactions,
	
	 including complex interactions, are considered. Numerical
	
	 simulations illustrate how Lagrangian dynamics, which is
	
	 characterized by a mixed phase space with coexisting regular and
	
	 chaotic motion regions, influences plankton patchiness generation
	
	 depending on the nature of the biological interactions.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of drifter trajectories in the Gulf of Mexico has revealed the existence of a region on the southern portion of the West Florida Shelf (WFS) that is not visited by drifters that are released outside of the region. This so릀alled ``forbidden zone'' (FZ) suggests the existence of a persistent cross릗helf transport barrier on the southern portion of the WFS. In this letter a year릐ong record of surface currents produced by a Hybrid륝oordinate Ocean Model simulation of the WFS is used to compute Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which reveal the presence of a persistent cross릗helf transport barrier in approximately the same location as the boundary of the FZ. The location of the cross릗helf transport barrier undergoes a seasonal oscillation, being closer to the coast in the summer than in the winter. A month릐ong record of surface currents inferred from high릃requency (HF) radar measurements in a roughly 60 km 횞 80 km region on the WFS off Tampa Bay is also used to compute LCSs, and these also reveal the presence of transient transport barriers. While the HF릖adar릁erived transport barriers cannot be unambiguously linked to the boundary of the FZ, this analysis does demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring transport barriers on the WFS using a HF릖adar륿ased measurement system. The implications of a persistent cross릗helf transport barrier on the WFS for the development of harmful algal blooms on the shoreward side of the barrier are considered.},

	Abstract = {On the basis of all available tide gauge records, bathythermograms,
	and Nansen bottle casts, we have compiled, on a global scale, monthly
	departures of recorded and steric sea levels from their annual means.
	The steric fluctuation is defined is terms of the seasonal fluctuation
	in specific volume. The results are given in the appendices and in
	three charts, together with error estimates. In general, the departures
	are comfortably above the uncertainties introduced by year to yew
	variations and by the effects of local topography. Recorded and steric
	departures agree remarkably well in low and temperate latitudes (conditions
	are isostatic). In these regions the steric levels are associated
	largely with temperature fluctuations in the upper 100 m. In high
	latitudes conditions are indeterminate. Pronounced semiannual fluctuations
	are found along the west coast of South, Africa, in Indonesia, in
	corresponding regions of the Labrador and Oyashio currents and in
	the Gulf of Mexico and adjoining Gulf Stream stations (but not in
	the Kuroshio!). Elsewhere the oscillations are largely annual in
	character, with low set level in each hemisphere during its spring
	and with high level during the fall. Recorded amplitudes vary from
	a few centimeters in the tropics to a few decimeters at higher latitudes;
	they exceed one meter in the Bay of Bengal. Atmospheric pressure
	effects and long period astronomic tides account for only a small
	part of the recorded fluctuations.},

	incompressible fluid, formulated by V. Arnold, stability is understood
	as stability with respect to perturbations with vorticity small in
	$L^2$. Nothing has been known about the stability under perturbations
	with small energy, without any restrictions on vorticity; it was
	clear that existing methods do not work for this (the most physically
	reasonable) class of perturbations. We prove that in fact every nontrivial
	steady flow is unstable in $L^2$; moreover, every flow may be transformed
	into any other one, with the same energy and momentum, with the help
	of an appropriately chosen perturbation with arbitrary small energy.
	This phenomenon reminds one of the Arnold diffusion. This result
	is proven by the direct construction of a growing perturbation, which
	is done by a variational method.}},

	Abstract = {Riemannian metric tensors are used to control the adaptation of meshes
	for finite element and finite volume computations. To study the numerous
	metric construction and manipulation techniques, a new method has
	been developed to visualize two-dimensional metrics without interference
	from an adaptation algorithm. This method traces a network of orthogonal
	tensor lines, tangent to the eigenvectors of the metric field, to
	form a pseudo-mesh visually close to a perfectly adapted mesh but
	without many of its constraints. Anisotropic metrics can be visualized
	directly using such pseudo-meshes but, for isotropic metrics, the
	eigensystem is degenerate and an anisotropic perturbation has to
	be used. This perturbation merely preserves directional information
	usually present during metric construction and is small enough, about
	1% of the prescribed target element size, to be visually imperceptible.
	Both analytical and solution-based examples show the effectiveness
	and usefulness of the present method. As an example, pseudo-meshes
	are used to visualize the effect on metrics of Laplacian-like smoothing
	and gradation control techniques. Application to adaptive quadrilateral
	mesh generation is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Meso- and submesoscales (fronts, eddies, filaments) in surface ocean
	flow have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics
	partly control the foraging behavior and the displacement of marine
	top predators (tuna, birds, turtles and cetaceans). In this work
	we focus on the role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique
	Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird.
	Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov
	exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs)
	present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation
	period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite
	positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track
	precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the
	first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges
	to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long
	and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several
	hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs.
	The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric
	current changes over the structures to move along these biologic
	corridors. The birds being often associated with tuna schools around
	foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of their foraging behavior
	and movement during the breeding season is crucial not only to seabird
	ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach to fisheries
	in the channel.},

	scenario. This unsteady behaviour is caused by a modulation of the
	core and satellite vortices due to the parabolic topography of the
	free fluid surface. It is shown that the main characteristics of
	the tripole evolutionare quit well described by a simple modulated
	point-vortex model. In addition to describing the trajectories of
	the individual vortices, this model is also capable of describing
	the advenction of fluid elements.},

	pressure gradients, as well as the meridional pressure gradients
	at the equator in the Gulf of Guinea, were studied in response to
	the seasonal synoptic wind field from eight FOCAL (programme Francais
	Ocean Climat Atlantique equatorial) basin-wide hydrographic
	cruises in the equatorial Atlantic from October 1982 to September
	1984. The vertically integrated zonal pressure gradient to 130 m
	was in equibrium with the zonal wind stress in the western central
	Atlantic. In the Gulf of Guinea, the frictional influence of the
	average local wind stress did not penetrate below the strong equatorial
	thermocline lying at the mean depth of 50 m. A very dramatic 50 m
	deepening of the equatorial thermocline occurred in February 1984
	in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, following a basin-wide relaxation
	of the winds in December 1983-January 1984. The resulting large zonal
	pressure gradient anomaly of February 1984 in the Gulf of Guinea
	was not forced by the local wind stress. The meridional structure
	of the first empirical orthogonal function of the sea levels at 6^E,
	as well as the vertical structure of the pressure gradient anomalies
	in the Gulf of Guinea, suggests a contribution of the second baroclinic
	mode during this warm event. Cross correlation statistics of bandpass
	filtered sea levels at 29^21'W and 6^31'E bolsters the occurrence
	of remotely forced second vertical mode Kelvin waves between February

	Annote = {Temperature and velocity time series, obtained by surface moorings
	during the Seasonal Response of the Equatorial Atlantic Experiment,
	are used to investigate the role of ocean dynamics upon the annual
	cycle of equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) and upper ocean
	heat. The annual cycle in SST is explained by different mechanisms,
	each operant at different phases of the cycle. The boreal springtime
	decrease in SST results from upwelling in response to the seasonal
	intensification of easterly wind stress. This upwelling causes the
	seasonal formation of the cold tongue along the equator in the central
	and eastern portions of the basin. An early summer increase SST is
	attributed to the meridional convergence of Reynolds heat flux associated
	with surface current instability-generated waves. After the instability
	waves abate, SST and mixed layer depth remain relatively steady from
	late summer through fall when the advective ar small and cancelling,
	suggesting that surface heating is then balanced by a diffusive flux
	at the base of the mixed layer. SST increases in wintertime following
	the the seasonal ralaxation in easterly wind stress, thus completing
	its annual cycle. This increase is attributed to the concentration
	of the surface flux over a mixed layer that is shoaling due to both
	the basin-wide adjustment of the thermocline and the local reduction
	in turbulent energy production. Thus SST variatios are found to be
	most closely controled by ocean dynamics during those times when
	the thermocline is adjusting basin-wide to the seasonal changes in
	wind stress; either directly by large advective fluxes (boreal spring-summer)
	or indirectly by mediating mixed layer depth (boreal winter). Analyses
	at 75 m depth show zonal and vertical advenction to be important,
	and within a control volume over the upper 150 m all of the advective
	terms are important.},

	triangular truncation of T85. Temporal variations of the total kinetic
	energy, the total enstrophy and the enstrophy dissipation rate are
	found to be influenced by both the spherical geometry and the rotation
	rate. The energy spectrum is different from that in the 棺-plane
	experiments with Cartesian geometry.
	
	
	Morphology of streamfunction and vorticity fields is investigated
	for several rotation rates. In nonrotational cases, isolated coherent
	vortices emerge in the course of time development as in the planar
	2D turbulence. As the rotation rate increases, however, the temporal
	evolution of the flow field changes drastically and an easterly
	circumpolar vortex appears in high latitudes. The flow field is then
	anisotropic in all the latitudes and elongated in the longitudinal
	direction. Temporal evolution of the flow field is characterized
	by Rossby wave motions.},

	used to explain the hypothesis. Three numerical experiments have
	been performed to compare the oceanic responses to a remote forcing,
	a local forcing and a combinated forcing. It is found that the long
	Rossby waves excited by the remotely forced Kelvin waves contribute
	substantially to the variability of the local circulation. This research

@article{Zavala-02,
	Abstract = {The results are presented in two main scenarios: (a) weak interactions
	, which occur at early stages of the experiments, when the vortex
	is far from the ridge and thus weakly experiences the in- fluence
	of the topography. In these situations, the vortex slowly drifts
	towards the ridge with a leftward inclination due to the ascending
	slope of the topography. Such a behaviour is similar to the northwestern
	motion of cyclones over a weak sloping bottom. The circular shape
	of the monopolar vortex is preserved. (b) Strong interactions , in
	which the vortex core reaches the ridge and presents a more complicated
	evolution. The cyclone climbs to the top of the topography and
	crosses to the other side. Once the vortex experiences the opposite
	slope, it moves backwards trying to return to the original side of
	the ridge. For strong enough vortices, this process may be repeated
	a number of times until the vortex is dissipated by viscous effects.
	During these interactions the shape of the vortex is strongly deformed
	and several filaments are produced. In some cases the vortex is cleaved
	in two parts when crossing the ridge, one at each side of it and
	moving in opposite directions.},
