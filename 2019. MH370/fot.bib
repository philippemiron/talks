	debris in the open ocean. However, the magnitude and the fate of
	this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina
	2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys and previously published
	reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface
	of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of
	each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However,
	the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated
	to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected.
	Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris
	point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized
	fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve
	a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into
	particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean
	interior by food webs and ballasting processes and processes yet
	to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris
	is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance
	of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean.},

This unsteady behaviour is caused by a modulation of the core and satellite vortices due to the parabolic topography of the free fluid surface. It is shown that the main characteristics of the tripole evolutionare quit well described by a simple modulated point-vortex model. In addition to describing the trajectories of the individual vortices, this model is also capable of describing the advenction of fluid elements.},

	While the more baroclinic rings can cross the ridge more easily we
	can expect that rings that still have a relatively strong barotropic
	component while reaching the Walvis Ridge shall be slowed down or
	be steered along the bathymetry due to vorticity effects until they
	have adjusted to a less barotropic state.
	
	
	An increase of mixing due to the ridge as was suggested by for instance
	Byrne et al. (1995) and Schouten et al. (2000) is not in agreement
	with our findings. We find the same results as Kamenkovich et al.
	(1996) that rings that encounter a topographic ridge transport more
	tracer. The tracer loss of the ring that crosses the ridge is 5%
	less in the case presented here. A large topographic ridge is thus
	responsible for less stirring of Agulhas water from the ring, which
	is perhaps quite counter-intuitive. We have not, however, explored
	the effects or variations of possible small-scale mixing events due
	to, for instance, internal waves.},

  number        = {11},
  pages         = {2820--2838},
  abstract      = {Abstract The surface current response to winds is analyzed in a 2-yr
	time series of a 12-MHz (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) off the west coast
	of France. Consistent with previous observations, the measured currents,
	after filtering tides, are on the order of 1.0\%--1.8\% of the wind
	speed, in a direction 10$\,^{\circ}$--40$\,^{\circ}$ to the right
	of the wind and with systematic trends as a function of wind speed.
	This Lagrangian current can be decomposed as the vector sum of a
	quasi-Eulerian current UE, representative of the top 1 m of the water
	column and part of the wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface.
	Here, Uss is estimated with an accurate numerical wave model using
	a novel parameterization of wave dissipation processes. Using both
	observed and modeled wave spectra, Uss is found to be very well approximated
	by a simple function of the wind speed and significant wave height,
	generally increasing quadratically with the wind speed. Focusing
	on a site located 100 km from the mainland, the wave-induced contribution
	of Uss to the radar measurement has an estimated magnitude of 0.6\%--1.3\%
	of the wind speed, in the wind direction---a percentage that increases
	with wind speed. The difference UE of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions
	is found to be on the order of 0.4\%--0.8\% of the wind speed and
	45$\,^{\circ}$--70$\,^{\circ}$ to the right of the wind. This relatively
	weak, quasi-Eulerian current with a large deflection angle is interpreted
	as evidence of strong near-surface mixing, likely related to breaking
	waves and/or Langmuir circulations. Summer stratification tends to
	increase the UE response by up to a factor of 2 on average and further
	increase the deflection angle of UE by 5$\,^{\circ}$--10$\,^{\circ}$.
	At locations closer to the coast, Uss is smaller and UE is larger
	with a smaller deflection angle. These results would be transposable
	to the World Ocean if the relative part of geostrophic currents in
	UE was weak, which is expected. This decomposition into Stokes drift
	and quasi-Eulerian current is most important for the estimation of
	energy fluxes to the Ekman layer.},

	leakage originates from coastal cities, particularly during extreme
	rainfall events. As coastal cities continue to grow, finding ways
	to reduce this macroplastic leakage is extremely pertinent. Here,
	we explore why and how coastal cities can reduce macroplastic leakages
	during extreme rainfall events. Using nine global cities as a basis,
	we establish that while cities actively create policies that reduce
	plastic leakages, more needs to be done. Nonetheless, these policies
	are economically, socially and environmentally cobeneficial to the
	city environment. While the lack of political engagement and economic
	concerns limit these policies, lacking social motivation and engagement
	is the largest limitation towards implementing policy. We recommend
	cities to incentivize citizen and municipal engagement with responsible
	usage of plastics, cleaning the environment and preparing for future
	extreme rainfall events.},

	The 1990s-decline, of about 15\% of the long-term mean, appears as
	part of a decadal variability of the gyre transport driven by changes
	in both heat flux and wind stress associated with the North Atlantic
	Oscillation (NAO). The changes in the subpolar gyre, as manifested
	in the deep western boundary current off Labrador, reverberate in
	the strength of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the
	subtropical North Atlantic, suggesting the potential of a subpolar
	transport index as an element of a MOC monitoring system.},

	contamination problems and the design of efficient and effective
	techniques to mitigate these problems require the capability to predict
	the behavior of chemical contaminants in flowing water. To choose
	an appropriate remediation strategy, knowledge of the contaminant
	release source and time release history becomes pertinent. With more
	and more contamination sites being detected nowadays, it is almost
	impossible to perform exhaustive drilling, testing, and chemical
	fingerprint analysis every time, especially in the case of pollution
	being generated by highway construction and repair materials. Moreover,
	most of the time, chemical finger printing, state and federal agency
	records, and private parties' history records of handling hazardous
	substances are not sufficient to allow a unique solution for the
	timing of source releases. The purpose of this chapter is to present
	and review mathematical methods that have been developed during the
	past 15 years to perform hydrologic inversion and specifically to
	identify the contaminant source location and time-release history.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical results relating to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory,
	particularly those dealing with the stability of degenerate one-degree-of-freedom
	Hamiltonian systems under a time-quasiperiodic perturbation, have
	led to the expectation that, independent of the background Potential
	Vorticity (PV) distribution, associated with zonal jets should be
	barriers which inhibit meridional transport. In a recently submitted
	paper (Beron-Vera et al. , 2011) the aforementioned expectation is
	confirmed based on the analysis of isentropic winds in the lower
	stratosphere as produced by a comprehensive general circulation model.
	Concretely, barriers for meridional transport are found to be associated
	with the (eastward) austral polar night jet, for which the meridional
	gradient of background PV is very steep and also for the (westward)
	boreal summer subtropical jet, for which the background PV is rather
	uniform. The identification of the meridional transport barriers
	is based on the computation of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE),
	which measures the amount of stretching about fluid particle trajectories.
	The meridional transport barriers, which are formed by fluid particle
	trajectories lying on invariant tori, are identified with topologically
	circular locally minimizing curves or trenches of the backward-plus-forward
	FTLE field. Results from explicit passive tracer advection experiments
	and flux computations are also presented, which confirm those inferred
	using the FTLE diagnostic. In this paper I present results based
	on the analysis of analytically prescribed stratospheric model winds,
	which complement the results presented in Beron-Vera et al. (2011)
	and further allow one to better assess the scope of the FTLE diagnostic.},

  abstract     = {The detection of vortices in geophysical flows is important because
	of their role in global circulation and transport. The recent theory
	of elliptic Lagrangian coherent structures has shown that long-lived,
	coherent material eddies exhibiting no filamentation can be extracted
	from altimetry-derived surface velocities associated with slow, mesoscale
	motions in the ocean. Since similarly perfect eddies may not be expected
	to exist in the presence of faster, submesoscale motions, it has
	remained unclear whether persistent and materially coherent eddies
	can in fact be identified objectively even in highly resolved ocean
	data. Here we show that under a suitable extension of the notion
	of material coherence, coherent eddies at the mesoscale and submesoscale
	level can indeed be simultaneously detected from multiscale velocity
	data.The emergence of coherent Lagrangian swirls (CLSs) among submesoscale
	motions in the ocean is illustrated. This is done by applying recent
	nonlinear dynamics tools for Lagrangian coherence detection on a
	surface flow realization produced by a data-assimilative submesoscale-permitting
	ocean general circulation model simulation of the Gulf of Mexico.
	Both mesoscale and submesoscale CLSs are extracted. These extractions
	prove the relevance of coherent Lagrangian eddies detected in satellite-altimetry{\textendash}based
	geostrophic flow data for the arguably more realistic ageostrophic
	multiscale flow.},

	drifters deployed near the Deepwater Horizon site in the Gulf of
	Mexico are investigated. The synthetic trajectories derive from a
	1-km-resolution data-assimilative Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM)
	simulation. The in situ drifters were launched in the Grand Lagrangian
	Deployment (GLAD). Diverse measures of the dispersion are calculated
	and compared to theoretical predictions. For the NCOM pairs, the
	measures indicate nonlocal pair dispersion (in which pair separations
	grow exponentially in time) at the smallest sampled scales. At separations
	exceeding 100 km, pair motion is uncorrelated, indicating absolute
	rather than relative dispersion. With the GLAD drifters, however,
	the statistics are ambiguous, with some indicating local dispersion
	(in which pair separations exhibit power-law growth) and others suggesting
	nonlocal dispersion. The difference between the two datasets stems
	in part from inertial oscillations, which affect the energy levels
	at small scales without greatly altering pair dispersion. These were
	significant in GLAD but much weaker in the NCOM simulation. In addition,
	the GLAD drifters were launched over a limited geographical area,
	producing few independent realizations and hence lower statistical
	significance. Restricting the NCOM set to pairs launched at the same
	locations yields very similar results, suggesting the model is for
	the most part capturing the observed dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Previously unresolved three-dimensional aspects of the time mean,
	as well as the annual and semiannual cycles of the heat transport,
	are studied in the Gulf of California using a minimal box model suggested
	by the hydrographic data. At the very least three horizontal domains
	are needed for the model: a shallow region north of the big islands,
	a deep region identifiable with the Ballenas Channel and another
	deep region spanning the rest of the gulf south of the archipelago.
	Only one vertical layer is considered in the northern region, whereas
	two layers are taken into account in the other two regions. Out of
	all of the possible heat exchanges among the various boxes of the
	model, the least-flux-variance solution is considered. The annual
	mean heat entering the surface in the northern region is exported
	in almost equal amounts to the Ballenas Channel and the southern
	region. Ballenas Channel, in turn, exports heat to the southern region
	mainly through the lower layer, producing a transversal asymmetry
	of the mouthward flux into the upper layer. At the mouth the heat
	is exported to the Pacific Ocean largely through the upper layer.
	Both the annual and semiannual amplitude of the exchanges between
	all regions are as important as the annual average, except at the
	mouth of the gulf, where the semiannual component is not statistically
	relevant. The Pacific Ocean fluxes estimates at the annual frequency
	agree well with those produced by a baroclinic wave, which has been
	shown to explain a big deal of the thermodynamics of the gulf. The
	annual mean vertical flux per unit horizontal area in the Ballenas
	Channel is much larger than that in the southern region. This reinforces
	previous speculations that mixing processes in this region are very
	important. A depth-independent eddy diffusivity parameterization
	suggests that diffusion might not be invoked to explain the annual
	mean vertical flux in the Ballenas Channel.},

  abstract      = {Mesophotic coral reefs (30{\^a}$\neg${{\"{A}}}$\neg${\`{i}}150 m) have recently received increased
	attention as a potential source of larvae (e.g., the refugia hypothesis)
	to repopulate a select subset of the shallow water (30 m) coral
	fauna. To test the refugia hypothesis we used highly polymorphic
	Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers as a means
	to assess small-scale genetic heterogeneity between geographic locations
	and across depth clines in the Caribbean coral, Montastraea cavernosa.
	Zooxanthellae-free DNA extracts of coral samples (N = 105) were analyzed
	from four depths, shallow (3{\^a}$\neg${{\"{A}}}$\neg${\`{i}}10 m), medium (15{\^a}$\neg${{\"{A}}}$\neg${\`{i}}25
	m), deep (30{\^a}$\neg${{\"{A}}}$\neg${\`{i}}50 m) and very deep (60{\^a}$\neg${{\"{A}}}$\neg${\`{i}}90 m) from Little
	Cayman Island (LCI), Lee Stocking Island (LSI), Bahamas and San Salvador
	(SS), Bahamas which range in distance from 170 to 1,600 km apart.
	Using AMOVA analysis there were significant differences in {\^I}$\neg${{\P}}ST
	values in pair wise comparisons between LCI and LSI. Among depths
	at LCI, there was significant genetic differentiation between shallow
	and medium versus deep and very deep depths in contrast there were
	no significant differences in {\^I}$\neg${{\P}}ST values among depths at LSI.
	The assignment program AFLPOP, however, correctly assigned 95.7%
	of the LCI and LSI samples to the depths from which they were collected,
	differentiating among populations as little as 10 to 20 m in depth
	from one another. Discriminant function analysis of the data showed
	significant differentiation among samples when categorized by collection
	site as well as collection depth. FST outlier analyses identified
	2 loci under positive selection and 3 under balancing selection at
	LCI. At LSI 2 loci were identified, both showing balancing selection.
	This data shows that adult populations of M. cavernosa separated
	by depths of tens of meters exhibits significant genetic structure,
	indicative of low population connectivity among and within sites
	and are not supplying successful recruits to adjacent coral reefs
	less than 30 m in depth.},

	material surface within the water column. By using the mean position
	of the material surface as the vertical coordinate, the authors obtain
	the depth dependence of the mean flow and the wave-induced forcing.
	Substitution of the vertical coordinate makes the model Lagrangian
	in the vertical direction. The model is Eulerian in the horizontal

  abstract      = {Abstract Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements and
	surface drifters released from two oceanographic cruises conducted
	during March 2006 and January/February 2007 are used to investigate
	the circulation off the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS).
	We show that the \{MBRS\} circulation can be divided into two distinct
	regimes, a northern region dominated by the strong, northward-flowing
	Yucatan Current, and a southern region with weaker southward coastal
	currents and the presence of the Honduras Gyre. The latitude of impingement
	of the Cayman Current onto the coastline varies with time, and creates
	a third region, which acts as a boundary between the northern and
	southern circulation regimes. This circulation pattern yields two
	zones in terms of dispersal, with planktonic propagules in the northern
	region being rapidly exported to the north, whereas plankton in the
	southern and impingement regions may be retained locally or regionally.
	The latitude of the impingement region shifts interannually and intra-annually
	up to 3{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ in latitude. Sub-mesoscale features are
	observed in association with topography, e.g., flow bifurcation around
	Cozumel Island, flow wake north of Chinchorro Bank and separation
	of flow from the coast just north of Bahia de la Ascencion. This
	third feature is evident as cyclonic recirculation in coastal waters,
	which we call the Ascencion-Cozumel Coastal Eddy. An understanding
	of the implications of these different circulation regimes on water
	mass distributions, population connectivity, and the fate of land-based
	pollutants in the \{MBRS\} is critically important to better inform
	science-based resource management and conservation plans for the
	\{MBRS\} coral reefs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In the summer and fall of 2012, during the \{GLAD\} experiment
	in the Gulf of Mexico, the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport
	of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) used several ocean models
	to assist the deployment of more than 300 surface drifters. The Navy
	Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) at 1{~}km and 3{~}km resolutions,
	the \{US\} Navy operational \{NCOM\} at 30 km resolution (AMSEAS),
	and two versions of the Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) set
	at 4{~}km were running daily and delivering 72-h range forecasts.
	They all assimilated remote sensing and local profile data but they
	were not assimilating the drifter{\textquoteright}s observations. This work presents
	a non-intrusive methodology named Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter
	that allows assimilating the local drifter data into such a set of
	models, to produce improved ocean currents forecasts. The filter
	is to be used when several modeling systems or ensembles are available
	and/or observations are not entirely handled by the operational data
	assimilation process. It allows using generic in situ measurements
	over short time windows to improve the predictability of local ocean
	dynamics and associated high-resolution parameters of interest for
	which a forward model exists (e.g. oil spill plumes). Results can
	be used for operational applications or to derive enhanced background
	fields for other data assimilation systems, thus providing an expedite
	method to non-intrusively assimilate local observations of variables
	with complex operators. Results for the \{GLAD\} experiment show
	the method can improve water velocity predictions along the observed
	drifter trajectories, hence enhancing the skills of the models to
	predict individual trajectories.},

	While the emphasis is on zonal flows in laboratory plasmas, planetary
	zonal flows are discussed as well. The review presents the status
	of theory, numerical simulation and experiments relevant to zonal
	flows. The emphasis is on developing an integrated understanding
	of the dynamics of drift wave-zonal flow turbulence by combining
	detailed studies of the generation of zonal flows by drift waves,
	the back-interaction of zonal flows on the drift waves and the various
	feedback loops by which the system regulates and organizes itself.
	The implications of zonal flow phenomena for confinement in and the
	phenomena of fusion devices are discussed. Special attention is given
	to the comparison of experiment with theory and to identifying directions
	for progress in future research.},

	Ocean. The rate of eddy mixing is typically quantified through an
	eddy diffusivity. There is an ongoing debate as to whether eddy mixing
	in enhanced in the core of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current or on
	its flanks. A simple expression is derived that predicts the rate
	of eddy mixing, that is, the eddy diffusivity, as a function of eddy
	and mean current statistics. This novel expression predicts suppression
	of the cross-jet eddy diffusivity in the core of the Antarctic Circumpolar
	Current, despite enhanced values of eddy kinetic energy. The expression
	is qualitatively and quantitatively validated by independent estimates
	of eddy mixing from altimetry observations. This work suggests that
	the meridional eddy diffusivity across the Antarctic Circumpolar
	Current is weaker than presently assumed because of the suppression
	of eddy mixing by the strong zonal current.},

	of the reef-building coral Agaricia agaricites (Linnaeus) were investigated
	through field experiments. Survival, chlorophyll concentrations,
	and solubilized protein concentrations were determined for larvae
	spawned from colonies at 3 and 24 m depth and subjected to one of
	three light regimes at 3, 10, or 24 m depth for 72 h: PAR (photosynthetically
	active radiation, 40- to 700 nm) only, PAR+UVA, or PAR+UVA+UVB. At
	3 m depth, larvae in the PAR+UVA+UVB treatment showed lower survivorship
	than larvae exposed to either PAR alone or PAR+UVA. Within the PAR+UVA+UVB
	treatment at 3 m depth, larvae from colonies at 24 m depth suffered
	higher mortality than those from 3 m. Differences in survivorship
	between larvae originating from 3 and 24 m depth corresponded with
	tissue concentrations of UVB-protective mycosporine-like amino acids:
	larvae from 3 m had higher concentrations of mycosporine-glycine
	($\lambda$max=310nm) and palythine ($\lambda$max=320nm) than those
	from 24 m depth. Chlorophyll concentrations were inversely correlated
	with PAR intensities, but variation in this parameter did not appear
	to be detrimental. These results show that sensitivity to high intensities
	of UVB radiation may affect survival of A. agaricites larvae in shallow
	reef-waters.},

  volume       = {99},
  pages        = {12,767-12,771},
  abstract     = {This note discusses the representation of steric sea level in ocean
	circulation models. Changes in steric sea level are caused when changes
	in the density of the water column imply an expansion or contraction
	of the column. Models usually make the Boussinesq approximation and
	conserve volume, rather than mass and so do not properly represent
	expansion or contraction. This cleans that although expansion/contraction
	is included in the equation of state, it is not accounted for by
	the model dynamics. In this note, we examine the equation governing
	the time evolution of the sea level displacement. It is shown that
	requiring conservation of mass, rather than volume, introduces a
	new term to this equation. A simple example is used to show the relationship
	of the new term to the surface buoyancy flux. The equilibrium response
	to the new term has two parts. One part consists of the Goldsbrough
	and Stommel gyres, for which, in the ocean interior, vortex stretching
	due to the local expansion/contraction of the water column is balanced
	by changes in planetary vorticity. The other part corresponds to
	the 'inverse barometer.' The effect is to adjust sea level by a globally
	uniform but time-varying factor, determined by the net expansion/contraction
	of the global ocean. Since this correction is globally uniform, it
	has no dynamical significance. Both the Goldsbrough/Stommel gyres
	and the inverse barometer solution are missing from models as currently
	formulated. This does not represent a serious error. However, if
	comparison is made with observations of sea level, model-calculated
	sea level should be adjusted by a globally uniform, tune-varying
	factor, determined by the net expansion/contraction of the global
	ocean. This would be important for assessing the likely rise in sea
	level in response to global warming.},

  abstract      = {AbstractFourteen autonomous profiling floats, equipped with CTDs were
	deployed in the deep eastern and western basins of the Gulf of Mexico
	over a four-year interval (July 2011--August 2015), producing a total
	of 706 casts. This is the first time since the early 1970's that
	there has been a comprehensive survey of water masses in the deep
	basins of the Gulf, with better vertical resolution than available
	from older ship-based surveys. Seven floats had 14-day cycles with
	parking depths of 1500 m, and the other half from the US Argo program
	had varying cycle times. Maps of characteristic water masses, including
	Subtropical Underwater, Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and North
	Atlantic Deep Water, showed gradients from east to west, consistent
	with their sources being within the Loop Current (LC) and the Yucatan
	Channel waters. Altimeter SSH was used to characterize profiles being
	in LC or LC eddy water or in cold eddies. The two-layer nature of
	the deep Gulf shows isotherms being deeper in the warm anticyclonic
	LC and LC eddies and shallower in the cold cyclones. Mixed-layer
	depths have an average seasonal signal that shows maximum depths,
	~60 m, in January, and a minimum in June-July, ~20 m. Basin-mean
	steric heights from 0--50 m dynamic heights and altimeter SSH show
	a seasonal range of ~12 cm, with significant inter-annual variability.
	The translation of LC eddies across the western basin produce a region
	of low homogeneous potential vorticity centered over the deepest
	part of the western basin.},

  annotation   = {The classical problem of the response of a balanced, axisymmteric vortex to thermal and mechanical forcing is re-examined, paying special attention to the lower boundary condition. The correct condition is D@/Dt=0, where @ es the geopotential y D/Dt the material derivative, which explicity accounts for a mass redistribution as part of the mean-flow response. This redistribution is neglected when using the boundary Dp/Dt=0, which has conventionally been applied in this problem. It is shown that applying the incorrect boundary condition and thereby ignoring the surface pressure change, leads to a zonal winds aceleration du/dt that is too strong, specially near the surface. The effect is significant for planetary-scale forcing even when applied at tropopause level. A comparison is made between the mean-flow evolution in a baroclinic life-cycle, as simulated in a fully nonlinear, primitive equation model and that predicted by using the simulated eddy fluxes in the zonally-symmetric response problem. Use of the correct lower boundary condition is shown to lead to improved agreement.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a quasi-3D Bayesian inversion of oceanographic
	tracer data from the South Atlantic Ocean. Initially, one active
	neutral-density layer is considered with an upper and lower boundary.
	The available hydrographic data are linked to model parameters (water
	velocities, diffusion coefficients) via a 3D advection-diffusion
	equation. A robust solution to the inverse problem can be obtained
	by introducing prior information about parameters and modeling the
	observation error. This approach estimates both horizontal and vertical
	flow as well as diffusion coefficients. A system of alternating zonal
	jets is found at the depths of the North Atlantic Deep Water, consistent
	with direct measurements of flow and concentration maps. A uniqueness
	analysis of the model is performed in terms of the oxygen consumption
	rate. The vertical mixing coefficient bears some relation to the
	bottom topography even though the authors do not incorporate topography
	into their model. The method is extended to a multilayer model, using
	thermal wind relations weakly in a local fashion (as opposed to integrating
	the entire water column) to connect layers vertically. Results suggest
	that the estimated deep zonal jets extend vertically, with a clear
	depth-dependent structure. The vertical structure of the flow field
	is modified by the tracer fields relative to the a priori flow field
	defined by thermal wind. The velocity estimates are consistent with
	independent observed flow at the depths of the Antarctic Intermediate
	Water; at still shallower depths, above the layers considered here,
	the subtropical gyre is a significant feature of the horizontal flow.},

	is used to examine physical controls on harmful algal bloom formation
	along the Texas coast. Karenia brevis, which blooms frequently in
	the Gulf of Mexico, has a relatively slow growth rate (doubling times
	of 2-3 days). Increases in K. brevis concentration cannot be explained
	simply in terms of growth. We hypothesize that the primary mechanism
	responsible for bloom formation in the western Gulf of Mexico is
	convergence due to downwelling at the coast. Convergence along the
	Texas coast caused by seasonal downwelling winds can concentrate
	the plankton up to 1000 times. This is surprising because the modeled
	cells do not grow; the simulated increase in concentration is due
	to physical processes alone. The numerical model qualitatively reproduces
	both the timing and magnitude of bloom initiation along the coast,
	but does not predict the details of the migration of the bloom along
	the coast after it has formed, or the destruction of the bloom. The
	result of this simulation is significant because it implies that
	K. brevis blooms may be caused primarily by physical processes and
	that cell division is not an important factor in bloom formation.},

  abstract      = {Whether mesophotic reefs will behave as refugia for corals threatened
	by global climate change and coastal development depends on vertical
	exchange of larvae between diverse habitats. Here we use a biophysical
	model of larval dispersal to estimate vertical connectivity of a
	broadcasting (Orbicella faveolata) and a brooding (Porites astreoides)
	species of coral in the US Virgin Islands. Modeling predicts subsidy
	to shallow areas by mesophotic larvae of both species based on local
	hydrology, adult reproductive characteristics, larval traits, and
	a wide range of scenarios developed to test depth-sensitive factors,
	such as fertilization rates and post-settlement survivorship. In
	extreme model scenarios of reduced fertilization and post-settlement
	survivorship of mesophotic larvae, 1--10 {\%} local mesophotic subsidy
	to shallow recruitment is predicted for both species, which are demographically
	significant. Although direct vertical connectivity is higher for
	the broadcaster, the brooder demonstrates higher local multigenerational
	vertical connectivity, which suggests that local P. astreoides populations
	are more resilient than those of O. faveolata, and corroborates field
	studies. As shallow habitat degrades, mesophotic--shallow subsidy
	is predicted to increase for both species. This study is the first
	of its kind to simulate larval dispersal and settlement between habitats
	of different depths, and these findings have local, regional, and
	global implications for predicting and managing coral reef persistence
	in a changing climate.},

	to test these systems down to scales previously unobtainable. In
	this study, background error covariance assumptions in the 3DVar
	assimilation process are perturbed to understand the effect on the
	solution relative to the withheld dense drifter data. Results show
	that the amplitude of the background error covariance is an important
	factor as expected, and a proposed new formulation provides added
	skill. In addition, the background error covariance time correlation
	is important to allow satellite observations to affect the results
	over a period longer than one daily assimilation cycle. The results
	show the new background error covariance formulations provide more
	accurate placement of frontal positions, directions of currents and
	velocity magnitudes. These conclusions have implications for the
	implementation of 3DVar systems as well as the analysis interval
	of 4DVar systems.},

	for amplitude decay of 2680 km. This long scale, combined with the
	tracer transport, indicates that Agulhas eddies, which cross the
	Walvis Ridge, are capable of carrying their observed thermal and
	salinity anomalies far into the South Atlantic subtropical gyre.},

	particles in a periodic external flow is studied within the framework
	of the barotropic, quasi-geostrophic approximation on f-plane. The
	concept of background currents advanced by Kozlov [1995. Background
	currents in geophysical hydrodynamics. Izvestia, Atmos. Oceanic Phys.
	31 (2), 245-250] is used to construct a dynamically consistent stream
	function satisfying the potential vorticity conservation law. It
	is shown that a system of two topographic vortices revolving about
	a rotation center can form in a circular external flow. Unsteady
	periodic perturbations, associated with either variations in the
	background current or deviations of the external flow from circulation,
	are analyzed. Unsteadiness in the external flow essentially complicates
	the pattern of the motion of fluid particles. Vortex-type quasi-periodic
	structures, identified with nonlinear resonances that form in Lagrangian
	equations of fluid particle advection, are examined. They either
	surround the stationary configuration by a vortex chain--a ringlet-like
	structure [Kennelly, M.A., Evans, R.H., Joyce, T.M., 1985. Small-scale
	cyclones on the periphery of Gulf Stream warm-core rings. J. Geophys.
	Res. 90(5), 8845-8857], or they form a complex-structure multivortex
	domain. Asymptotic estimates and numerical modeling are used to study
	the distribution and widths of the nonlinear resonance domains that
	appear under unsteady perturbations of different types. The onset
	of chaotic regimes owing to the overlapping of nonlinear resonance
	domains is analyzed. Transport fluxes determined by chaotic advection
	and barriers for transport (KAM-tori) and the conditions of their
	existence are studied. The relation of the rotation frequency of
	fluid particles on their initial position (when the dependence is
	calculated in the undisturbed system) is shown to completely determine
	the main features of the pattern of Lagrangian trajectories and chaotization
	effects. Because of nonlinear effects, the domain involved in quasi-periodic
	and chaotic motions can be much larger than the domain occupied by
	steady topographic vortices. The results of study by Sokolovskiy
	et al. [1988. On the influence of an isolated submerged obstacle
	on a barotropic tidal flow. Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. 88(1),
	1-30] concerning the due regard on the irrotational background component
	as the necessary factor for the transportation of fluid particles
	from the vortex domain to infinity are confirmed.},

	appear in various application areas, either as the final result of
	simulations or as intermediate product. Due to their complexity,
	tensors are hard to interpret. This motivates the development of
	well-conceived visualization methods. As a sub-branch of scientific
	visualization, tensor field visualization has been especially pushed
	forward by diffusion tensor imaging. In this review, we focus on
	second-order tensors that are not diffusion tensors. Until now, these
	tensors, which might be neither positive-definite nor symmetric,
	are under-represented in visualization and existing visualization
	tools are often not appropriate for these tensors. Hence, we discuss
	the strengths and limitations of existing methods when dealing with
	such tensors as well as challenges introduced by them. The goal of
	this paper is to reveal the importance of the field and to encourage
	the development of new visualization methods for tensors from various
	application fields.},

  abstract      = {Because of its relevance for the global climate the Atlantic meridional
	overturning circulation (AMOC) has been a major research focus for
	many years. Yet the question of which physical mechanisms ultimately
	drive the AMOC, in the sense of providing its energy supply, remains
	a matter of controversy. Here we review both observational data and
	model results concerning the two main candidates: vertical mixing
	processes in the ocean's interior and wind{\quotesinglbase}{{\"{A}}}{\^{e}}induced Ekman upwelling
	in the Southern Ocean. In distinction to the energy source we also
	discuss the role of surface heat and freshwater fluxes, which influence
	the volume transport of the meridional overturning circulation and
	shape its spatial circulation pattern without actually supplying
	energy to the overturning itself in steady state. We conclude that
	both wind{\quotesinglbase}{{\"{A}}}{\^{e}}driven upwelling and vertical mixing are likely contributing
	to driving the observed circulation. To quantify their respective
	contributions, future research needs to address some open questions,
	which we outline.},

	deployment of ~1000 biodegradable GPS-tracked Consortium for Advanced
	Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE)
	drifters to measure submesoscale upper-ocean currents and their potential
	impact on oil spills. The experiment was conducted from January to
	February 2016 in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near the mouth of the Mississippi
	River, an area characterized by strong submesoscale currents. A Helmholtz-Zentrum
	Geesthacht (HZG) marine X-band radar (MR) on board the R/V F. G.
	Walton Smith was used to locate fronts and eddies by their sea surface
	roughness signatures. The MR data were further processed to yield
	near-surface current maps at ~500-m resolution up to a maximum range
	of ~3 km. This study employs the drifter measurements to perform
	the first comprehensive validation of MR near-surface current maps.
	For a total of 4130 MR--drifter pairs, the root-mean-square error
	for the current speed is 4 cm and that for the current direction
	is 12{$^{\circ}$}. The MR samples currents at a greater effective depth than
	the CARTHE drifters (1--5 m vs ~0.4 m). The mean MR--drifter differences
	are consistent with a wave- and wind-driven vertical current profile
	that weakens with increasing depth and rotates clockwise from the
	wind direction (by 0.7\% of the wind speed and 15{$^{\circ}$}). The technique
	presented here has great potential in observational oceanography,
	as it allows research vessels to map the horizontal flow structure,
	complementing the vertical profiles measured by ADCP.},

	most applications. It does not explain why certain strctures are

	biological responses differ. Mode-water eddies can generate extraordinary

  abstract     = {The problem of the origin of midlatitude cyclonic disturbances having
	characteristic spatial scales of 1000 km or less has remained outstanding
	for most of this century. Although the theory of baroclinic instability
	of Charney and Eady has often been assumed to account for their appearance,
	Charney himself recognized that this was not so. In an attempt to
	develop a unique explanation for the observed scale of these systems
	we have been reinvestigating the classical problem of the baroclinic
	instability of synoptic-scale frontal zones. This work has shown
	that when the stability of such regions is analyzed using the hydrostatic
	primitive equations, a new mode of baroclinic instability is revealed,
	which has precisely the required scale. The new mode is completely
	filtered out in both the quasi-geostrophic and semigeostrophic systems.
	
	
	 In the present paper we return to the primitive equations system
	to further analyze this problem and to refine the numerical formulation
	so as to enable an accurate investigation of the sensitivity of the
	growth rate and spatial scale of the new mode to the detailed properties
	of the background frontal flow. This demonstrates that focusing of
	the region of low Richardson number near the surface is most conducive
	to the growth of the cyclone wave.},

	 spatial pattern formation in the distribution of plankton near the
	
	 ocean's surface is investigated. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are
	
	 treated as biologically interacting tracers that are passively
	
	 advected by a divergence-free two-dimensional nonsteady velocity
	
	 field. The time-dependence of this field is assumed to be
	
	 quasiperiodic, which extends the analysis presented beyond standard
	
	 chaotic advection. Various forms of predator--prey interactions,
	
	 including complex interactions, are considered. Numerical
	
	 simulations illustrate how Lagrangian dynamics, which is
	
	 characterized by a mixed phase space with coexisting regular and
	
	 chaotic motion regions, influences plankton patchiness generation
	
	 depending on the nature of the biological interactions.},

	simulation of the WFS is used to compute Lagrangian coherent structures
	(LCSs), which reveal the presence of a persistent cross{\quotesinglbase}{{\"{A}}}{\^{e}}shelf transport
	barrier in approximately the same location as the boundary of the
	FZ. The location of the cross{\quotesinglbase}{{\"{A}}}{\^{e}}shelf transport barrier undergoes

  abstract      = {AbstractThe large-scale circulation of the bottom layer of the Gulf
	of Mexico is analyzed, with special attention to the historically
	least studied western basin. The analysis is based on 4 years of
	data collected by 158 subsurface floats parked at 1500 and 2500 m
	and is complemented with data collected by current meter moorings
	in the western basin during the same period. Three main circulation
	patterns stand out: a cyclonic boundary current, a cyclonic gyre
	in the abyssal plain, and the very high eddy kinetic energy observed
	in the eastern Gulf. The boundary current and the cyclonic gyre appear
	as distinct features, which interact in the western tip of the Yucatan
	shelf. The persistence and continuity of the boundary current is
	addressed. Although high variability is observed, the boundary flow
	serves as a pathway for water to travel around the western basin
	in approximately 2 years. An interesting discovery is the separation
	of the boundary current over the northwestern slope of the Yucatan
	shelf. The separation and retroflection of the along-slope current
	appears to be a persistent feature and is associated with anticyclonic
	eddies whose genesis mechanism remains to be understood. As the boundary
	flow separates, it feeds into the westward flow of the deep cyclonic
	gyre. The location of this gyre---named the Sigsbee Abyssal Gyre---coincides
	with closed geostrophic contours, so eddy--topography interaction
	via bottom form stresses may drive this mean flow. The contribution
	to the cyclonic vorticity of the gyre by modons traveling under Loop
	Current eddies is discussed.},

	departures of recorded and steric sea levels from their annual means.
	The steric fluctuation is defined is terms of the seasonal fluctuation
	in specific volume. The results are given in the appendices and in
	three charts, together with error estimates. In general, the departures
	are comfortably above the uncertainties introduced by year to yew
	variations and by the effects of local topography. Recorded and steric
	departures agree remarkably well in low and temperate latitudes (conditions
	are isostatic). In these regions the steric levels are associated
	largely with temperature fluctuations in the upper 100 m. In high
	latitudes conditions are indeterminate. Pronounced semiannual fluctuations
	are found along the west coast of South, Africa, in Indonesia, in
	corresponding regions of the Labrador and Oyashio currents and in
	the Gulf of Mexico and adjoining Gulf Stream stations (but not in
	the Kuroshio!). Elsewhere the oscillations are largely annual in
	character, with low set level in each hemisphere during its spring
	and with high level during the fall. Recorded amplitudes vary from
	a few centimeters in the tropics to a few decimeters at higher latitudes;
	they exceed one meter in the Bay of Bengal. Atmospheric pressure
	effects and long period astronomic tides account for only a small
	part of the recorded fluctuations.},

  abstract      = {AbstractThe evolution and dispersion of intermediate water masses
	in the ocean interior is studied. To this purpose, an empirical statistical
	model of Lagrangian tracers at a constant depth level is developed.
	The model follows the transfer operator based on 10-day deep displacements
	of Argo floats at ~1000 m depth. An asymptotic analysis of the model
	shows the existence of 10 principal stationary points (the 10 locations
	attract asymptotically 97\% of the tracers). It takes ~1000 years
	to reach this asymptotic regime relevant for estimating the stationary
	points. For Lagrangian floats, the concept of attractor needs to
	be generalized in a statistical sense (versus deterministic), except
	for a few places in the ocean. In this new framework, a tracer has
	a likelihood to reach the stationary points, rather than a certainty
	to reach a single stationary point. The empirical statistical model
	is used to describe the fate of three intermediate water masses:
	North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), Mediterranean Water (MW),
	and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). These experiments show a
	dramatic difference in the long-time behavior of NPIW, MW, and AAIW.
	In the permanent regime, the NPIW concentrates locally (in the Kuroshio
	recirculation) and the MW remains mainly regional (concentrated in
	the subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic), whereas the AAIW spreads
	globally (well mixed throughout the entire ocean).},

  abstract     = {AbstractThe second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2)
	was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades
	to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model
	components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr
	period (1979--2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry
	out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982--2010). This was
	done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill
	estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions
	at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system
	ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable
	up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the
	seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show
	that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from
	6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly
	doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over
	the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts
	over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved
	guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products
	for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of
	retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products.
	These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used
	by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in
	areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation,
	energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal
	prediction of the hurricane season.},

	incompressible fluid, formulated by V. Arnold, stability is understood
	as stability with respect to perturbations with vorticity small in
	$L^2$. Nothing has been known about the stability under perturbations
	with small energy, without any restrictions on vorticity; it was
	clear that existing methods do not work for this (the most physically
	reasonable) class of perturbations. We prove that in fact every nontrivial
	steady flow is unstable in $L^2$; moreover, every flow may be transformed
	into any other one, with the same energy and momentum, with the help
	of an appropriately chosen perturbation with arbitrary small energy.
	This phenomenon reminds one of the Arnold diffusion. This result
	is proven by the direct construction of a growing perturbation, which
	is done by a variational method.}},

  annotation   = {A nonlinear Stommel model of the ocean circulation on the beta plane, driven by a time periodic wind stress, is investigate in order to study symmetry properties of the observed time-mean ocean gyres. Due to the presence of vorticity advection terms the model will have a steady or rectified response to fluctuating wind fields. In this paper a small inverse Ekman number, 'the small beta regime', is considered. It is demostrated that for this case all qualitative features of the residual circulation, obtained numerically by Veronis (1970), are reproduced in an analytical way. They include the dipole character of the gyre, its maximum symmetry breaking around the north-south axis for intermediate Reynolds numbers, measuring the ratio of vorticity forcing and dissipation and the maximum residual response for intermediate forcing frequencies.},

	for finite element and finite volume computations. To study the numerous
	metric construction and manipulation techniques, a new method has
	been developed to visualize two-dimensional metrics without interference
	from an adaptation algorithm. This method traces a network of orthogonal
	tensor lines, tangent to the eigenvectors of the metric field, to
	form a pseudo-mesh visually close to a perfectly adapted mesh but
	without many of its constraints. Anisotropic metrics can be visualized
	directly using such pseudo-meshes but, for isotropic metrics, the
	eigensystem is degenerate and an anisotropic perturbation has to
	be used. This perturbation merely preserves directional information
	usually present during metric construction and is small enough, about
	1% of the prescribed target element size, to be visually imperceptible.
	Both analytical and solution-based examples show the effectiveness
	and usefulness of the present method. As an example, pseudo-meshes
	are used to visualize the effect on metrics of Laplacian-like smoothing
	and gradation control techniques. Application to adaptive quadrilateral
	mesh generation is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Meso- and submesoscales (fronts, eddies, filaments) in surface ocean
	flow have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics
	partly control the foraging behavior and the displacement of marine
	top predators (tuna, birds, turtles and cetaceans). In this work
	we focus on the role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique
	Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird.
	Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov
	exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs)
	present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation
	period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite
	positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track
	precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the
	first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges
	to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long
	and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several
	hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs.
	The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric
	current changes over the structures to move along these biologic
	corridors. The birds being often associated with tuna schools around
	foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of their foraging behavior
	and movement during the breeding season is crucial not only to seabird
	ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach to fisheries
	in the channel.},

  abstract     = {AbstractThe passage of a winter storm over the Gulf Stream observed
	with a Lagrangian float and hydrographic and velocity surveys provided
	a unique opportunity to study how the interaction of inertial oscillations,
	the front, and symmetric instability (SI) shapes the stratification,
	shear, and turbulence in the upper ocean under unsteady forcing.
	During the storm, the rapid rise and rotation of the winds excited
	inertial motions. Acting on the front, these sheared motions modulate
	the stratification in the surface boundary layer. At the same time,
	cooling and downfront winds generated a symmetrically unstable flow.
	The observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation exceeded what could
	be attributed to atmospheric forcing, implying SI drew energy from
	the front. The peak excess dissipation, which occurred just prior
	to a minimum in stratification, surpassed that predicted for steady
	SI turbulence, suggesting the importance of unsteady dynamics. The
	measurements are interpreted using a large-eddy simulation (LES)
	and a stability analysis configured with parameters taken from the
	observations. The stability analysis illustrates how SI more efficiently
	extracts energy from a front via shear production during periods
	when inertial motions reduce stratification. Diagnostics of the energetics
	of SI from the LES highlight the temporal variability in shear production
	but also demonstrate that the time-averaged energy balance is consistent
	with a theoretical scaling that has previously been tested only for
	steady forcing. As the storm passed and the winds and cooling subsided,
	the boundary layer restratified and the thermal wind balance was
	reestablished in a manner reminiscent of geostrophic adjustment.},

	using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim
	reanalysis (ERA-Interim) at 250, 500, and 850 hPa. For each level,
	two criteria are used. The first criterion is the traditional criterion
	of absolute vorticity that is opposite in sign to the local Coriolis
	parameter. The second criterion, referred to as the gradient criterion,
	is the traditional criterion with an added term incorporating flow
	curvature. Both criteria show that instability, on all pressure levels,
	occurs most frequently in the tropics and decreases toward the poles.
	Compared to the traditional criterion, the gradient criterion diagnoses
	instability much more frequently outside the tropics and less frequently
	near the equator. The global distribution of inertial instability
	also shows many local maxima in the occurrence of instability. A
	sample of these local maxima is investigated further by constructing
	composites of the synoptic-scale flow associated with instability.
	The composites show that instability occurs in association with cross-equatorial
	flow in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Somali jet, tip jets off northern
	Madagascar, the western Pacific subtropical high, gap winds across
	Central America, upper-level ridging over western North America,
	and the North Atlantic polar jet. Furthermore, relatively long-lived

  annotation   = {Most of the principal qualitative features of the El Niano-Southern Oscillation phenomenon can be explained by a simple but physically motivated theory. These features are the occurrence of sea-surface warmings in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the associated trade wind reversal; the aperidicity of these events; the preferred onset time with respect to the seasonal cycle; and thje much weaker events inthe Atlantic and Indian oceans. The theory, in its simplest form, is a conceptual model for the interaction of just three variables, namely near-surface temperatures in the east and west equatorial ocean and a wind driven current advecting the temperature field. For alrge range of parameters, the model is naturally chaotic and aperiodically produces El Niano-like events. For a smaller basin, representing a smaller ocean, the events are proportionally less intense.},

  pages        = {1--26},
  annotation   = {The vertical structures (relative to 500 dbar) of the equatorial pressure gradients, as well as the meridional pressure gradients at the equator in the Gulf of Guinea, were studied in response to the seasonal synoptic wind field from eight FOCAL (programme Francais Ocean Climat Atlantique equatorial) basin-wide hydrographic cruises in the equatorial Atlantic from October 1982 to September 1984. The vertically integrated zonal pressure gradient to 130 m was in equibrium with the zonal wind stress in the western central Atlantic. In the Gulf of Guinea, the frictional influence of the average local wind stress did not penetrate below the strong equatorial thermocline lying at the mean depth of 50 m. A very dramatic 50 m deepening of the equatorial thermocline occurred in February 1984 in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, following a basin-wide relaxation of the winds in December 1983-January 1984. The resulting large zonal pressure gradient anomaly of February 1984 in the Gulf of Guinea was not forced by the local wind stress. The meridional structure of the first empirical orthogonal function of the sea levels at 6^E, as well as the vertical structure of the pressure gradient anomalies in the Gulf of Guinea, suggests a contribution of the second baroclinic mode during this warm event. Cross correlation statistics of bandpass filtered sea levels at 29^21'W and 6^31'E bolsters the occurrence of remotely forced second vertical mode Kelvin waves between February 1983 and November 1984 in the equatorial Atlantic.},

  pages        = {84--96},
  annotation   = {Temperature and velocity time series, obtained by surface moorings during the Seasonal Response of the Equatorial Atlantic Experiment, are used to investigate the role of ocean dynamics upon the annual cycle of equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) and upper ocean heat. The annual cycle in SST is explained by different mechanisms, each operant at different phases of the cycle. The boreal springtime decrease in SST results from upwelling in response to the seasonal intensification of easterly wind stress. This upwelling causes the seasonal formation of the cold tongue along the equator in the central and eastern portions of the basin. An early summer increase SST is attributed to the meridional convergence of Reynolds heat flux associated with surface current instability-generated waves. After the instability waves abate, SST and mixed layer depth remain relatively steady from late summer through fall when the advective ar small and cancelling, suggesting that surface heating is then balanced by a diffusive flux at the base of the mixed layer. SST increases in wintertime following the the seasonal ralaxation in easterly wind stress, thus completing its annual cycle. This increase is attributed to the concentration of the surface flux over a mixed layer that is shoaling due to both the basin-wide adjustment of the thermocline and the local reduction in turbulent energy production. Thus SST variatios are found to be most closely controled by ocean dynamics during those times when the thermocline is adjusting basin-wide to the seasonal changes in wind stress; either directly by large advective fluxes (boreal spring-summer) or indirectly by mediating mixed layer depth (boreal winter). Analyses at 75 m depth show zonal and vertical advenction to be important, and within a control volume over the upper 150 m all of the advective terms are important.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Wind-induced shell currents and wave-induced mass transports
	at various fetches of both clean and slick sea surfaces are separately
	estimated. At the clean surface, the ratio between wind-induced current
	and wind velocity decreases, while the ratio between wave-induced
	current and wind velocity increases, with increasing fetch. The total
	surface drift current, the sum of wind- and wave-induced components,
	decreases gradually with increasing fetch and approaches 3.1\% of
	wind velocity at long fetches, comparing very favorably with measured
	values. At a slick surface, the wind-induced drift current is reduced
	due to a decrease of the wind-stress coefficient and the wave-induced
	mass transport is increased due to an additional wave damping. As
	a result of these opposite effects, the total surface drift current
	at a slick surface differs much less significantly than individual
	components from that at a clean surface. It is also suggested that
	the surface mass transport can be calculated simply from characteristics
	of dominant waves and that discrepancy between earlier measured currents
	of clean and slick surfaces is due to a direct momentum flux from
	wind to waves. Finally, linear superposition of wind- and wave-induced
	components and effects of water depth on surface drift currants are
	discussed.},

  abstract     = {A series of numerical experiments on the decaying two dimensional
	turbulence is performed for a nondivergent barotropic fluid on a
	rotating sphere by using a high-resolution spectral model with a
	triangular truncation of T85. Temporal variations of the total kinetic
	energy, the total enstrophy and the enstrophy dissipation rate are
	found to be influenced by both the spherical geometry and the rotation
	rate. The energy spectrum is different from that in the {{\OE}}$\leq$-plane
	experiments with Cartesian geometry.
	
	
	Morphology of streamfunction and vorticity fields is investigated
	for several rotation rates. In nonrotational cases, isolated coherent
	vortices emerge in the course of time development as in the planar
	2D turbulence. As the rotation rate increases, however, the temporal
	evolution of the flow field changes drastically and an easterly circumpolar
	vortex appears in high latitudes. The flow field is then anisotropic
	in all the latitudes and elongated in the longitudinal direction.
	Temporal evolution of the flow field is characterized by Rossby wave
	motions.},

A simpled reduced-gravity oceanic model is used to explain the hypothesis. Three numerical experiments have been performed to compare the oceanic responses to a remote forcing, a local forcing and a combinated forcing. It is found that the long Rossby waves excited by the remotely forced Kelvin waves contribute substantially to the variability of the local circulation. This research indicates that equatorial Kelvin waves are one of the major factors determining the circulation in eastern equatorial Indian Ocean.},

  abstract     = {The results are presented in two main scenarios: (a) weak interactions
	, which occur at early stages of the experiments, when the vortex
	is far from the ridge and thus weakly experiences the in- fluence
	of the topography. In these situations, the vortex slowly drifts
	towards the ridge with a leftward inclination due to the ascending
	slope of the topography. Such a behaviour is similar to the northwestern
	motion of cyclones over a weak sloping bottom. The circular shape
	of the monopolar vortex is preserved. (b) Strong interactions , in
	which the vortex core reaches the ridge and presents a more complicated
	evolution. The cyclone climbs to the top of the topography and crosses
	to the other side. Once the vortex experiences the opposite slope,
	it moves backwards trying to return to the original side of the ridge.
	For strong enough vortices, this process may be repeated a number
	of times until the vortex is dissipated by viscous effects. During
	these interactions the shape of the vortex is strongly deformed and
	several filaments are produced. In some cases the vortex is cleaved
	in two parts when crossing the ridge, one at each side of it and
	moving in opposite directions.},
